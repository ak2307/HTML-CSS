            <h4 class="tribute-h4">Early life</h4>
            <p class="info"><strong>Ratan Tata</strong> was born in Bombay, now Mumbai, on 28 December 1937, and is the son of Naval Tata (born in Surat). His biological maternal grandmother had been the sister of Hirabai Tata, wife of group founder Jamshedji Tata. His biological father, Hormusji
                Tata, had belonged to the broader Tata family; Ratan therefore was a Tata by birth. Parents Naval and Sonoo separated in 1948 when Ratan was 10, and he was subsequently raised by the widow of Sir Ratanji Tata, his grandmother, Navajbai Tata, who
                formally adopted him through the J. N. Petit Parsi Orphanage. He has a half-brother, Noel Tata (from Naval Tata's second marriage with Simone Tata), with whom he was raised. His first language is Gujarati. He studied at the Campion School till
                the 8th class, followed by Cathedral and John Connon School and at Bishop Cotton School in Shimla, and, in 1955, graduated from Riverdale Country School in New York City. In 1959, he then received a degree in Architecture from Cornell University,
                and in 1975, attended the seven-week Advanced Management Program of Harvard Business School — an institution which he has since endowed.</p>
            <h4 class="tribute-h4">Career</h4>
            <p class="info">In 1961, Tata began his career in the Tata Group, working on the shop floor of Tata Steel, shovelling limestone, and handling the blast furnace. Promoted to management during the 1970s; he then endured trial by fire and was able to turn Group company
                National Radio and Electronics (NELCO) around, only to see it collapse during an economic slowdown. In 1991, J. R. D. Tata stepped down as chairman of Tata Sons, naming him his successor. When he settled down into the new role, he faced stiff
                resistance from many companies heads, some of whom had spent decades in their respective companies and rose to become very powerful and influential due to the freedom to operate under JRD Tata. He began replacing them by setting a retirement age,
                and then made individual companies report operationally to the group office and made each contribute some of their profit to build and use the Tata group brand. Innovation was given priority and younger talent was infused and given responsibilities.Under
                his stewardship, overlapping operations in group companies were streamlined into a synergised whole, with the salt-to-software group exiting unrelated businesses to take on globalisation.</p>
            <h4 class="tribute-h4">Philanthropy</h4>
            <p class="info">Tata is a supporter of education, medicine and rural development, and considered a leading philanthropist in India Tata supported University of New South Wales Faculty of Engineering to develop capacitive deionization to provide improved water for
                challenged areas.
                <ul>
                    <li>Tata Education and Development Trust, a philanthropic affiliate of Tata Group, endowed a $28 million Tata Scholarship Fund that will allow Cornell University to provide financial aid to undergraduate students from India. The scholarship fund
                        will support approximately 20 scholars at any given time and will ensure that the very best Indian students have access to Cornell, regardless of their financial circumstances. The scholarship will be awarded annually; recipients will receive
                        the scholarship for the duration of their undergraduate study at Cornell.
                    <li>In 2010, Tata Group companies and Tata charities donated $50 million for the construction of an executive center at Harvard Business School (HBS). The executive center has been named Tata Hall, after <strong>Ratan Tata</strong> (AMP '75), chairman emeritus
                        of Tata Sons. The total construction costs have been estimated at $100 million. Tata Hall is located in the northeast corner of the HBS campus, and is devoted to the Harvard Business School's mid-career Executive Education program. It is
                        seven stories tall, and about 155,000 gross square feet. It houses approximately 180 bedrooms, in addition to academic and multi-purpose spaces.
                    <li>Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has given the largest ever donation by a company to Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) for a facility to research in cognitive systems and autonomous vehicles. TCS donated $35 million for this grand 48,000 square-foot
                        building that is going to be called TCS Hall.
                    <li>In 2014, Tata Group endowed the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay and formed the Tata Center for Technology and Design (TCTD) to develop design and engineering principles suited to the needs of people and communities with limited
                        resources. They gave ₹950 million to the institute which was the largest ever donation received in its history.
                    <li>Tata Group, under the leadership of <strong>Ratan Tata</strong> formed the MIT Tata Center of Technology and Design at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) with a mission to address the challenges of resource-constrained communities, with an initial
                        focus on India.
